# Burger

In this repository, I have created a Burger application that takes in a user order and logs it to the left side of the page. On the right side of the page, are the burgers already devoured. To move a burger to the right side of the page, a user must click on the "Devour it!" button. Devoured or not, the application logs every burger order in the database.

<h1>Overview:</h1>
This repository connects all of the new technologies and concepts we have learned over the past week. The burger application utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The MVC design pattern was deployed so each file could communicate with one another. I used Handlebars to generate the overall HTML of the application.

<h1>Setup:</h1>
1) Clone the repository on your local device and open Terminal or Bash 2) In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install" 3) In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the application: "node server.js" 4) Once the command is run, a successful message will appear "connected with id____ on localhost:3000".

<h1>Technologies Utilized:</h1>
MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Heroku

<h1>Directory Structure:</h1>

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to continue building out this application, I would add in a layer of "deleting" a burger, prompting a user to enter a different burger if already chosen, and connecting into an API for nutritional information. A burger over a certain caloric count would alert the user within the application.
